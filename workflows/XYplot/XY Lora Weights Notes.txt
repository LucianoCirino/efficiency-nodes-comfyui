For the XY loRA weights mode to kick in there are a few rules to follow
	The LoRA you want to view with different model/clip weights should have one LoRA Stacker node per entry on an axis
		so you need 6 total entries for a 3x3, 8 for a 4x4, 10 for a 5x5, etc
	Only change one of the weights per axis
		for instance keep all model weights on X-axis entries "1" or whatever you want it to be, if they are the same it 		will use the other axis's value instead
	You can add extra LoRAs on top of the one you're changing weights on, but they must be in their own LoRA stacker nodes 	feeding into the X/Y axis changing LoRA stacker nodes. It's probably easiest to look at the example picture
